A simple React App I am making to learn more about the framework.

To get this project to run: open a bash terminal and clone this reposotary with `git clone https://github.com/BabyM0le/React-Piano-Website.git` then enter the directory with `cd React-Piano-Website`. To generate the node_modules folder run `npm install` then either start a development server by running `npm start` or make a build by running `npm run build`.

npm install body-parser
npm install express
npm install twilio
npm install dotenv
npm install nodemailer
npm install react-tsparticles react
