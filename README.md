A simple React App I am making (unfinished) to learn more about the framework.

To get this project to run: open a bash terminal and clone this reposotary with `git clone https://github.com/BabyM0le/React-Piano-Website.git` then enter the directory with `cd React-Piano-Website`. To generate the node_modules folder run `npm i` and install the dependancies with `npm i body-parser express twilio dotenv nodemailer react-tsparticles react`. You then need to create a .env file in ./src/node with your Twilio accountSID and AuthToken with these two variable names: `TwilioAccountSid TwilioAuthToken`then either start a development server by running `npm start` or make a build by running `npm run build`.
